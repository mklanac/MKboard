# MKboard
MKboard hardware: VESC-based PM synchronous motor controller

IPT007N06N MOSFETs are so powerful that the board should be able to run without any heatsink at all at 50A continuous.
Nothing is tested yet because I am still waiting for some parts to arrive. The controller will be used for my [e-bike project](https://grabcad.com/library/electric-bike-with-3d-printed-parts-1).
